# Program-1  Printing of a Matrix

Explanation with theory of the code : 
This C++ program demonstrates how to create and display a 2D matrix using user input. It begins by prompting the user to enter the number of rows and columns, then declares a fixed-size matrix capable of storing up to 56 rows and 46 columns. Using nested loops, it collects individual elements for each cell of the matrix and stores them accordingly. After input, the program prints the matrix in a structured format, row by row. It showcases fundamental concepts like arrays, loops, and input/output operations. 

Algorithm:
- Start
- Declare variables: a, b, and a 2D array matrix[56][46]
- Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and read a
- Prompt the user to enter the number of columns and read b
- Use nested loops to input each element of the matrix
- Use nested loops to display the matrix in row-column format
- End
